# GladRails - A gladiator management simulator built with Ruby on Rails

This long forgotten side project used to be my goto concept whenever i wanted to learn a new language. I must have rebuilt this thing atleast a half a dozen times in different languages and frameworks. It helped my get my head around Rails and a lot of web development areas that i had yet to encounter as a junior/med-level dev at the time.

The game concept was inspired by an old flash game i played as a teenager called "Kungfu Boy". In Kungfu Boy you would recruit, train, and battle your kungfu fighters against a mix of dummy accounts and actual players. You also had the ability to watch a replay of any other players recent fights which was very cool at the time. 

I went with more of a Spartacus themed game where you run your own Ludus.

After all these years gathering dust i think it's time i chuck the code on Github and see if i can tinker with it some more.
